# Project Goal Modes

Adapt documentation strategy based on the project's primary goal.

## Mode Definitions

**🔵 Production Stability** (live, incidents)
- Focus: runbooks, monitoring, hardening plans, security
- Depth: Deep operational documentation
- Priority: Reliability, incident response, security

**🟢 MVP Fast** (ship quick, validate)
- Focus: lean README, light PRD, quick start
- Depth: Minimal, essentials only
- Priority: Speed to market, basic functionality

**🟡 Research** (learning, PoC)
- Focus: brief with hypotheses, experiments, findings, decisions
- Depth: Light, learning-focused
- Priority: Document learnings, decisions, experiments

**🟣 Dev Tooling** (SDK, library, CLI)
- Focus: excellent README, API reference, examples, integration guides
- Depth: Comprehensive developer experience
- Priority: Ease of integration, clear API, examples

**⚪ Balanced** (standard product)
- Focus: full core pack (README, PRD, architecture, tests, runbooks, user guide)
- Depth: Comprehensive but balanced
- Priority: Complete documentation suite

## Mode Detection

**Infer from context when possible:**
- "launch ASAP" / "validate" → MVP
- "production" / "incidents" → Stability
- "SDK" / "library" → Dev Tooling
- "PoC" / "experiment" → Research

**Ask if unclear:**
"What's the primary goal: 🔵 Stability / 🟢 MVP / 🟡 Research / 🟣 Dev Tooling / ⚪ Balanced?"

**Always state your chosen mode explicitly** before generating documentation.
