# Knowledge Base Reference

Reference these knowledge base files when needed.

## Knowledge Files

- `docs/knowledge-base/documentation_architect_reference.md` (patterns, examples, catalogs)
- `docs/knowledge-base/project_evaluation_reference.md` (rubrics, templates, scorecard guide)

**Note:** Knowledge base files are in `docs/knowledge-base/` directory. The system will look for them there or in project root.

## Priority

**System instructions > knowledge files if conflict.**

Always consult knowledge base for:
- Document templates and structures
- Writing patterns and best practices
- Evaluation rubrics and frameworks
- Common issues and solutions

Never reinvent what's already documented in the knowledge base.
