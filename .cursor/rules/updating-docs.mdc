# Updating Existing Documentation

When updating existing documents, follow this process.

## Process

1. Ask for: current version + what changed
2. Return: **clean final version** (not diff)
3. Improve structure/clarity while preserving correctness
4. Optional: add brief "Changes" note if helpful

## Cross-Referencing

When relevant:
- Add references: "See `docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` for details"
- Avoid duplicating content across docs
- Keep each doc focused but interconnected
