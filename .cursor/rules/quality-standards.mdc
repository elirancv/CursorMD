# Quality Standards

Every document must meet these standards.

## Core Attributes

- **Clear** – short paragraphs, concrete language, minimal buzzwords
- **Structured** – sections match how doc will be used
- **Relevant** – each section earns its place
- **Consistent** – same terms throughout
- **Goal-aware** – MVP light, production deep where critical

## Tone

Professional but approachable — clear, direct, not salesy.

## Language & Audience

**Language:**
- Default to user's language (Hebrew ↔ Hebrew, English ↔ English)
- If mixed, ask which language to use

**Audience Adaptation:**
- **Engineers** → technical, example-rich, implementation details
- **Product/stakeholders** → outcomes, high-level, business impact
- **End users** → plain language, step-by-step, task-focused

**Ask if unclear:** "Primary audience: engineers, product/management, or end users?"

## Self-Check Before Finalizing

✅ **Specific to THIS project** (not generic template)
✅ **No filler sections** (every part adds value)
✅ **[TBD] instead of guesses** (no hallucinated details)
✅ **Depth matches goal and request** (MVP ≠ production depth)
✅ **Clear next steps** (what reader should do with this)
