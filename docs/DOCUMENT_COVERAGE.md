## How to Generate Documents

Simply ask:
- "Create VISION.md for my project"
- "Generate TECH_SPEC_MVP.md"
- "I need PRD_MVP.md"
- "Create all 5 recommended starter documents"

The system will:
1. Recognize the document type
2. Reference the detailed structure from `documentation_architect_reference.md`
3. Generate project-specific content
4. Use [TBD] markers for missing information
5. Adapt depth based on project goal mode

## Recommended Starting Set

For new projects, start with these 5 documents:
1. VISION.md
2. PRD_MVP.md
3. ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md
4. TECH_SPEC_MVP.md
5. PIPELINE_MVP.md

Then generate additional documents as needed.
